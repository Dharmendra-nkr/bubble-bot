# bubblebot
BubbleBot is an intelligent AI bot designed to search the web, collect relevant information, and present it to users in a simple, conversational format. It saves time by filtering noise and delivering only what matters.
=======
# BubbleBot — simple Flask frontend

Quick local frontend with floating bubbles and a centered chat bar.

Run locally:

```powershell
cd bubblebot
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
# then open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in a browser
```

The `/chat` endpoint currently echoes messages. Replace logic in `app.py` to hook your bot backend.
